# Constructs, Variables, Operational definition.

Construct a variable that is not directly observable or measurable. But once a construct has been operationally 
defined, variables are created. Examples of Construct: effort, itchiness, hunger, maturity, wisdom...


|Construct      |       Operational definition            |
|   :---:       |                  :---:                   |
|`Stress`       |       Level of cortisol (stress hormone) |
|`Hunger`       |       Gramms of food consumed            |
|`Effort`       |       Minutes spent studying for an exam |

**Operational definition** describes how researcher decide to measure the variables (in our case construct) in a study. It also
  helps you to measure constructs in the real world by turning them into measurable variables 

All experiments/researches examine some kind of variable(s). A variable is not only something that we measure, but also something that we can manipulate and something we can control for.

1. Dependent Variable or Outcome, or y-variable.
  - Is a variable that is dependent on an independent variable(s).

2. Independent Variable sometimes called Experimental Variable or Manipulated Variable, or Predicted, or x-variable.
  - Is a variable that is being manipulated in an experiment in order to observe the effect on a Dependent Variable, sometimes called an Outcome Variable.

3. Lurking Variables or Extraneous factors are variables/factors that can impact the Outcome/Dependent Variable.
