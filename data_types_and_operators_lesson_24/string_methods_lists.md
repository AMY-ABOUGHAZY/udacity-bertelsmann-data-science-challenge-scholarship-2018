# String Methods.

* Using methods is almost the same as using function: it takes arguments and returns a value. 
* To call method use dot notation. For example `sample_string.lower()`, methods could receive additional arguments, which are passed inside the parentheses.
* Methods are specific to the data type for a particular variable. So there are some built-in methods that are available for all strings, different methods that are available for all integers, etc.

# Lists!

A list is a sequence of values. Tge values in a list are called **elements** (sometimes **items**) and elements can be any type of data. For example:
```python
random_list = ['Gauda is a cheese?', 32, True ]

>>>random_list[-1]
True

>>>random_list[0]
Gauda is a cheese?
```
